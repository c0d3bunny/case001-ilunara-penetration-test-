## Reflected XSS Vulnerability â€“ ilunara.com

**Location:** Username field during account registration  
**Payload Used:** `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`  
**Execution Point:** Dashboard welcome text (post-login)

**Impact:**  
The application reflects unsanitized input directly into the DOM without proper encoding or filtering. This introduces a serious risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which could be exploited by attackers to:
- Steal session tokens
- Hijack user sessions
- Deface UI
- Redirect users to malicious domains

**Recommendation:**  
- Sanitize all input fields
- Encode user input before rendering to DOM
- Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP)
